# Hello 👋
## Abir this side,
🧑‍💻 I am a Backend Developer.

🍀 My go to Tech-Stack is MERN, but I also like to explore different technologies and frameworks like Next.js and EJS. 

🐍 I am equally proficient in Python and C++. Beside that, I also like to deep dive into data structures and alogorithms. 

⬆️I am constantly upgrading my skillset to solve real world problems.

🌟 In a nutshell, I am interested in anything related to coding :-)
